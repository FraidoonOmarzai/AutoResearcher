        "summary": "The wide exploration of large language models (LLMs) raises the awareness of\nalignment between healthcare stakeholder preferences and model outputs. This\nalignment becomes a crucial foundation to empower the healthcare workflow\neffectively, safely, and responsibly. Yet the varying behaviors of LLMs may not\nalways match with healthcare stakeholders' knowledge, demands, and values. To\nenable a human-AI alignment, healthcare stakeholders will need to perform\nessential roles in guiding and enhancing the performance of LLMs. Human\nprofessionals must participate in the entire life cycle of adopting LLM in\nhealthcare, including training data curation, model training, and inference. In\nthis review, we discuss the approaches, tools, and applications of alignments\nbetween healthcare stakeholders and LLMs. We demonstrate that LLMs can better\nfollow human values by properly enhancing healthcare knowledge integration,\ntask understanding, and human guidance. We provide outlooks on enhancing the\nalignment between humans and LLMs to build trustworthy real-world healthcare\napplications.",

        "summary": "This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation into applying large\nlanguage models, particularly on BioBERT, in healthcare. It begins with\nthoroughly examining previous natural language processing (NLP) approaches in\nhealthcare, shedding light on the limitations and challenges these methods\nface. Following that, this research explores the path that led to the\nincorporation of BioBERT into healthcare applications, highlighting its\nsuitability for addressing the specific requirements of tasks related to\nbiomedical text mining. The analysis outlines a systematic methodology for\nfine-tuning BioBERT to meet the unique needs of the healthcare domain. This\napproach includes various components, including the gathering of data from a\nwide range of healthcare sources, data annotation for tasks like identifying\nmedical entities and categorizing them, and the application of specialized\npreprocessing techniques tailored to handle the complexities found in\nbiomedical texts. Additionally, the paper covers aspects related to model\nevaluation, with a focus on healthcare benchmarks and functions like processing\nof natural language in biomedical, question-answering, clinical document\nclassification, and medical entity recognition. It explores techniques to\nimprove the model's interpretability and validates its performance compared to\nexisting healthcare-focused language models. The paper thoroughly examines\nethical considerations, particularly patient privacy and data security. It\nhighlights the benefits of incorporating BioBERT into healthcare contexts,\nincluding enhanced clinical decision support and more efficient information\nretrieval. Nevertheless, it acknowledges the impediments and complexities of\nthis integration, encompassing concerns regarding data privacy, transparency,\nresource-intensive requirements, and the necessity for model customization to\nalign with diverse healthcare domains.",
