      "📝 Summary:\n",
      "- The use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare requires alignment with the preferences, knowledge, and values of healthcare stakeholders to ensure effective, safe, and responsible workflows.\n",
      "- Healthcare professionals need to be involved in all stages of LLM adoption, including data curation, model training, and inference, to ensure human-AI alignment.\n",
      "- The review discusses methods to improve alignment between healthcare stakeholders and LLMs, emphasizing the need for better integration of healthcare knowledge, task understanding, and human guidance to build trustworthy healthcare applications.\n",

      "📝 Summary:\n",
      "- The paper investigates the application of large language models, specifically BioBERT, in healthcare, discussing its suitability for tasks related to biomedical text mining and outlining a systematic methodology for fine-tuning it to meet healthcare-specific needs. This includes data gathering, annotation, and specialized preprocessing techniques.\n",
      "- The research also covers model evaluation, focusing on healthcare benchmarks and functions like processing natural language in biomedical, question-answering, clinical document classification, and medical entity recognition. It also explores ways to improve the model's interpretability and compares its performance with existing healthcare-focused language models.\n",
      "- The paper highlights the benefits of incorporating BioBERT into healthcare, such as improved clinical decision support and efficient information retrieval, but also acknowledges challenges such as data privacy concerns, resource-intensive requirements, and the need for model customization to suit diverse healthcare domains.\n",

However, compressing Transformer remains as an\\nopen problem due to its internal complexity of the layer designs, i.e.,\\nMulti-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN).
